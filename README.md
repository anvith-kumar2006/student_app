AI-Based Student Performance Analysis and Backlog Risk Prediction System

Problem statement:

In many educational  institutions, identifying  backlogs is a challenging task. Traditional evaluation methods rely heavily on final exam results, which do not provide early warnings or insights into a student’s progress throughout the semester.
Factors such as low attendance, poor internal assessment scores, insufficient study hours, and previous academic history significantly influence a student’s performance. However, these factors are often not analyzed collectively in a systematic and data-driven manner.
This project aims to develop a system that analyzes student data using computational techniques to predict academic performance and assess the risk of backlogs in advance. By leveraging parameters such as attendance, internal marks, study habits, CGPA, and backlog history, the system provides early predictions and actionable insights.
The goal is to assist educators and institutions in identifying at-risk students at an early stage, enabling timely interventions, personalized support, and improved academic outcomes.
